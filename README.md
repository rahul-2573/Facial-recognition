# Facial-recognition
Install openCV, numpy before running the files. The program uses Haarcascade to detect the facial regions in a photo and uses KNN algorithm to predict the face in a live video stream.

First run face_data_collection, this would open up your webcam where one can store the datas of the people as a numpy array.

the face_recognition file would check the stored datas and display the name if it is already present.
